## Ben Furber

I’m a former product manager who’s done loads in digital other than the most important and difficult bit - so I’m learning to code with Makers Academy. I started out as a website designer before moving more into website management, I then founded a startup that received venture capital funding and later as website product owner for large charity.

I love being part of building digital products so I now want to dedicate myself to learning how to build technology in a proper way from those building really interesting things.

## Skills

#### Agile

From a product management prospective, I know how SCRUM works - turning business needs into user stories, discussing and amending those stories after discussion with developers and being part of daily, weekly and per-sprint ceremonies. 

At the Institute of Physics I worked to set-up a small Agile team and then at Marie Curie I lead a larger and well established Agile team.

#### Website Management

I've managed proprietary, open source ones (Wordpress, Drupal, Umbraco) and enterprise-level licensed (Episerver) Content Management Systems. These websites have ranged from having barely any traffic to multi-millions of users a year.

#### Design

From teaching myself Adobe products way back and using them to design websites, more recently I'll be found asking proper designers to 'move that to right a bit, please.'
