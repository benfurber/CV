Iâ€™m a former product manager turn developer trying to stay out of my comfort zone. I started out as a website designer/manager before running a startup and then later as website product owner for large charity. [I've learned to be a developer at Makers Academy](#education).

I love being part of building digital products, so I want to continue doing that as a developer - challenging myself as much as possible by building complex and difficult things for ambitious companies.

| ----------------------------| --------------|---------|
| [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/benfurber/bowling-challenge) |
| Webapp that scores a single player game of bowling. The scoring of bowling (and where to put all that business logic within React) is annoying deceptive. | React.<br/>Semantic UI. | Jest |
| [Alexa Skill - Dog Translator](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ben-Furber-Dog-Translator/dp/B07B28NH9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1523111280&sr=1-1&keywords=dog+translator) |
| A basic Alexa app that takes the user's command and 'whoofs' back at them. Very sophisticated. Has been used over 8.5k times! | JS.<br/>AWS - Lambda. | None. I built it last year, please forgive. |
| [MakersBnb](https://github.com/charmalt/makersbnb) |
| Group project at Makers Academy. Built the basic functionality of AirBnb. Users can sign-up, add rooms and rent rooms. I focused on the data models, ensuring they all interlinked correctly. | Ruby with Sinatra.<br/>Semantic UI. | RSpec.<br/>Capybara. |
| [Data visualisation dashboard](https://github.com/benfurber/datadashboard) |
| A small project to play around with data files. It can import a CSV, manipulates and turns it into JSON and then visualises it. | Node.js (file conversation, CSV manipulate). <br/>JS (V3, Chart.js).<br/>Bootstrap. | Again, it was before learning TDD - please forgive. |

I focused more on the getting our continuous deployment setup on AWS, [I also wrote a little about the 'fun' I had with it](https://medium.com/@benfurber/a-few-things-ive-learned-that-s-made-aws-less-scary-f5600f7e662a). | Ruby on Rails.<br/>AWS - Elastic Beanstalk (plus other).<br/>Bootstrap | RSpec for Rails.<br/>Capybara<br/>FactoryBot |

## <a name="skills">Skills/knowledge</a>

#### Good team worker
Having been part of so many big and small projects over the last decade I believe I've picked up a lot of lessons about how to be a good team member. I'm normally a calming influence and air on the side of over communicating.

#### Agile delivery
From a product management prospective, I know how SCRUM works - turning business needs into user stories, discussing and amending those stories after discussion with developers and being part of daily, weekly and per-sprint ceremonies.

At the Institute of Physics I worked to set-up a small Agile team and then at Marie Curie I lead a larger and well established Agile team.

#### Website management
I've managed proprietary, open source (Wordpress, Drupal, Umbraco) and enterprise-level (Episerver) Content Management Systems. These websites have ranged from having barely any traffic to multiple millions of users a year.

Pretty much just food really. Eating it, cooking it, reading about it, staring at it on Instagram. Can I be friends with Jamie Oliver now?
