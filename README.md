Product manager turned developer trying to stay out of my comfort zone. I started out as a website designer/manager before running a startup and then later as website product owner for large charity. [I've learned to be a developer at Makers Academy](#education).

I love being part of building digital products, so I want to continue doing that as a developer - challenging myself as much as possible by building complex and difficult things for ambitious companies.

## <a name="skills">Skills/knowledge</a>

#### Good team worker
Having been part of so many big and small projects over the last decade I believe I've picked up a lot of lessons about how to be a good team member. I'm normally a calming influence and air on the side of over communicating.

#### Agile delivery
From a product management prospective, I know how SCRUM works - turning business needs into user stories, discussing and amending those stories after discussion with developers and being part of daily, weekly and per-sprint ceremonies.

At the Institute of Physics I worked to set-up a small Agile team and then at Marie Curie I lead a larger and well established Agile team.

#### Website management
I've managed proprietary, open source (Wordpress, Drupal, Umbraco) and enterprise-level (Episerver) Content Management Systems. These websites have ranged from having barely any traffic to multiple millions of users a year.

Pretty much just food really. Eating it, cooking it, reading about it, staring at it on Instagram. Can I be friends with Jamie Oliver now?
