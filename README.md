I’m a former product manager trying to stay out of my comfort zone - [so I’m learning to become a junior developer at Makers Academy](#education). I started out as a website designer/manager, before (briefly) running a startup and later as website product owner for large charity.

I love being part of building digital products, so I want to continue doing that as a developer - staying out of my comfort zone as much as possible by building complex and difficult things for ambitious companies.

#### [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/benfurber/bowling-challenge)
A weekend challenge set by Makers Academy to produce a webapp that scores a single player game of bowling. This required writing all the scoring logic (which is annoying deceptive) and connecting that to the frontend as the user provides their rolls. This was my first try at building with React - which basically means I put my business logic in completely the wrong place.
- React (with Node.js)
- Jest (testing)
- Semantic UI (UI library)

#### [Alexa Skill - Dog Translator](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ben-Furber-Dog-Translator/dp/B07B28NH9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1523111280&sr=1-1&keywords=dog+translator)
A basic Alexa skill (that's what they call apps). It takes the user's command (e.g. "Alexa, tell my dog I'm leaving") and 'whoofs' back at them (it's very sophisticated). So far it's been used over 8.5k times!
- JS and Lambda on AWS

#### [MakersBnb](https://github.com/charmalt/makersbnb)
The first group project at Makers Academy. We built the basic functionality of AirBnb, enabling users to sign-up, put a room up to be rented and rent others' rooms. I focused my contributions towards the data models and ensuring they all interlink correctly.
- Ruby with Sinatra
- RSpec (testing)
- Semantic UI (UI library)

#### [Data visualisation dashboard](https://github.com/benfurber/datadashboard)
A small project to understand how to take a mock data file as if it's been exported from a tool (CSV), manipulate the data into a usable format (JSON) and then use a visualisation library to present that data (chart.js).
- Node.js (file conversation, CSV manipulate),
- JS (V3, Chart.js)
- Bootstrap (UI library)

#### [Social Media Platform - Fishnet](https://github.com/ZoeKavanagh/fishnet)
A fortnight long project for a group of four of us. The object was to build the basic functionality of a social media platform such as Facebook and, most importantly, get it deployed. I focused more on the deployment side getting a [continuous deployment workflow up and running on Amazon Web Services](http://fishes.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/), [I also wrote a little about the 'fun' I had with AWS](https://medium.com/@benfurber/a-few-things-ive-learned-that-s-made-aws-less-scary-f5600f7e662a).
- Ruby on Rails
- AWS (deployment)
- RSpec (testing)
- Bootstrap (UI library)

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Agile
From a product management prospective, I know how SCRUM works - turning business needs into user stories, discussing and amending those stories after discussion with developers and being part of daily, weekly and per-sprint ceremonies.

At the Institute of Physics I worked to set-up a small Agile team and then at Marie Curie I lead a larger and well established Agile team.

#### Website Management
I've managed proprietary, open source (Wordpress, Drupal, Umbraco) and enterprise-level (Episerver) Content Management Systems. These websites have ranged from having barely any traffic to multiple millions of users a year.

#### Design
From teaching myself Adobe products over ten years ago and using them to design websites a designers eye never goes away. Excusing learning Semantic UI's framework during my time at Makers, my more recent design experience has been managing professional designers when in Product roles.
